# Configuration Guide

This file is also in the `guides/` folder.

Since `guides/` doesn't have its own `toc.yml`, this file will appear alongside `installation.md` under the "Guides" section in the root TOC.

## Configuration Options

- `docfx.json` - Main configuration file
- `toc.yml` - Table of contents
- `filterConfig.yml` - API filter configuration
