# Getting Started

This file will be **automatically added** to the root TOC because:
- The root `toc.yml` has `auto: true`
- This file is in the same folder as the root `toc.yml`

## Quick Start

1. Create a `toc.yml` with `auto: true`
2. Add your markdown files
3. Run `docfx build`
4. Your TOC is automatically populated!
