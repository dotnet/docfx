<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <!-- id is lowercase and if you want a good separator for words, use '-', not '.'. Dots are only acceptable as suffixes for certain types of packages, e.g. .install, .portable, .extension, .template -->

    <!-- Note that unstable versions like 0.0.1 can be considered a released version, but it's possible that one can release a 0.0.1-beta before you release a 0.0.1 version. If the version number is final, that is considered a released version and not a prerelease. -->

    <summary>DocFX makes it extremely easy to generate your API reference, landing page, and how-to.</summary>
    <description>DocFx is a documentation generation tool for API reference and Markdown files!

*DocFX* is an API documentation generator for .NET, and currently it supports C# and VB.
It generates API reference documentation from triple-slash comments in your source code.
It also allows you to use Markdown files to create additional topics such as tutorials and how-tos, and to customize the generated reference documentation.
*DocFX* builds a static HTML website from your source code and Markdown files, which can be easily hosted on any web servers (for example, *github.io*).
Also, *DocFX* provides you the flexibility to customize the layout and style of your website through templates.
If you are interested in creating your own website with your own styles, you can follow [how to create custom template](howto_create_custom_template.md) to create custom templates.

### Features

* Website from Source Code and Markdown - DocFX generates Documentation directly from source code (.NET, RESTful API, JavaScript, Java, etc...) and Markdown files.
* Run Everywhere - DocFX runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. The generated website can be deployed to any web host with no additional configurations, e.g. Github Pages, Azure Websites...
* Easy Customization - DocFX provides a flexible way to customize templates and themes easily.
