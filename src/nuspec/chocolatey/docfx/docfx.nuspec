<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces 
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements 
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <!-- id is lowercase and if you want a good separator for words, use '-', not '.'. Dots are only acceptable as suffixes for certain types of packages, e.g. .install, .portable, .extension, .template -->

    <!-- Note that unstable versions like 0.0.1 can be considered a released version, but it's possible that one can release a 0.0.1-beta before you release a 0.0.1 version. If the version number is final, that is considered a released version and not a prerelease. -->

    <summary>DocFX makes it extremely easy to generate your API reference, landing page, and how-to.</summary>
    <description>DocFx is a documentation generation tool for api reference and markdown files!

DocFX is an API documentation generator for .NET, currently supporting C# and VB, as similar to JSDoc or Sphinx. It has the ability to extract triple slash comments out from your source code. What's more, it has syntax to link additional files to API to add additional remarks. docfx will scan your source code and your additional conceptual files and generate a complete HTML documentation website for you. docfx provides the flexibility for you to customize the website through templates. We currently have several embedded templates, including websites containing pure static html pages and also website managed by AngularJS. Of cause, if you are interested in creating your own website with your own styles, you can follow [how to create custom template to create custom templates](http://dotnet.github.io/docfx/tutorial/howto_create_custom_template.html) to create custom templates.

### Features

* Generate API Documentation - Able to generate API documentation from triple-slash-comments for .NET source code directly!
* Generate Conceptual Documentation - Able to generate HTML from markdown files supporting DFM syntax.
* Easy Customization - Able to customize templates and themes easily
