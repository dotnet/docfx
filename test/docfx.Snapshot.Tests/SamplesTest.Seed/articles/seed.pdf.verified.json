This includes runtime code changes, unit test updates, and deploymentscripts. For example, sending a PR for just an update to a unit test might seem like a waste of time butthe unit tests are just as important as the product code and as such, reviewing changes to them is alsojust as important.The advantages are numerous: improving code quality, more visibility on changes and their potentialimpact, avoiding duplication of effort, and creating general awareness of progress being made in variousareas.In general a PR should be signed off(using the \uD83D\uDC4D emoticon) by the Owner of that code.To commit the PR to the repo do not use the Big Green Button. Instead, do a typical push that youwould use with Git (e.g. local pull, rebase, merge, push).Source Code ManagementBranch strategyIn general:master has the code for the latest release on NuGet.org. (e.g. 1.0.0, 1.1.0)dev has the code that is being worked on but not yet released. This is the branch into which devsnormally submit pull requests and merge changes into. We run daily CI towards dev branch andgenerate pre-release nuget package, e.g. 1.0.1-alpha-9-abcdefsd.hotfix has the code for fixing master bug after it is released. hotfix changes will be merged back tomaster and dev once it is verified.Solution and project folder structure and namingSolution files go in the repo root. The default entry point is All.sln.Every project also needs a project.json and a matching .xproj file. This project.json is the source oftruth for a project's dependencies and configuration options.Solution need to contain solution folders that match the physical folder (src, test, tools, etc.).Assembly naming patternThe general naming pattern is Docfx.<area>.<subarea>.",

This will help ensure that the standard is followed by alldevelopers on the team in a consistent manner.\"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code thathumans understand\".Martin Fowler. Refactoring: Improving the design of existing code.PurposeThe aim of this section is to define a set of C# coding standards to be used by CAPS build team toguarantee maximum legibility, reliability, re-usability and homogeneity of our code. Each section ismarked Mandatory or Recommended. Mandatory sections, will be enforced during code reviews as wellas tools like StyleCop and FxCop, and code will not be considered complete until it is compliant.ScopeThis section contains general C# coding standards which can be applied to any type of applicationdeveloped in C#, based on Framework Design Guidelines\uF1C5.It does not pretend to be a tutorial on C#. It only includes a set of limitations and recommendationsfocused on clarifying the development.ToolsResharper\uF1C5 is a great 3rd party code cleanup and style tool.StyleCop\uF1C5 analyzes C# srouce code to enforce a set of style and consistency rules and has beenintegrated into many 3rd party development tools such as Resharper.FxCop\uF1C5 is an application that analyzes managed code assemblies (code that targets the .NETFramework common language runtime) and reports information about the assemblies, such aspossible design, localization, performance, and security improvements.C# Stylizer\uF1C5 does many of the style rules automaticallyHighlights of Coding StandardsThis section is not intended to give a summary of all the coding standards that enabled by ourcustomized StyleCop, but to give a highlight of some rules one will possibly meet in daily coding life. Italso provides some recommended however not mandatory(which means not enabled in StyleCop)coding standards.",

That one statement is nothing more thana call to the one method that you are trying to test. keeping that one statement as simple as possible isalso very important. For example, this is not ideal:This style is not recomended because way too many things can go wrong in this one statement. All theGetComplexParamN() calls can throw for a variety of reasons unrelated to the test itself. It is thus unclearto someone running into a problem why the failure occured.The ideal pattern is to move the complex parameter building into the `Arrange section:Now the only reason the line with CallSomeMethod() can fail is if the method itself blew up.Testing exception messagesIn general testing the specific exception message in a unit test is important. This ensures that the exactdesired exception is what is being tested rather than a different exception of the same type. In order toverify the exact exception it is important to verify the message.Use xUnit.net's plethora of built-in assertionsxUnit.net includes many kinds of assertions – please use the most appropriate one for your test. This willmake the tests a lot more readable and also allow the test runner report the best possible errors(whether it's local or the CI machine).

The text of the link willbecome the text of the tab header, displayed to the customer. In order for the header to be recognizedas a tab, the link itself must start with #tab/ and be followed by an ID representing the content of thetab.
