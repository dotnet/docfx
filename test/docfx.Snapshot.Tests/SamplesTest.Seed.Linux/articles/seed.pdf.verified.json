This includes runtime code changes, unittest updates, and deployment scripts. For example, sending a PR for just an update to aunit test might seem like a waste of time but the unit tests are just as important as theproduct code and as such, reviewing changes to them is also just as important.The advantages are numerous: improving code quality, more visibility on changes and theirpotential impact, avoiding duplication of eﬀort, and creating general awareness of progressbeing made in various areas.In general a PR should be signed oﬀ(using the \uD83D\uDC4D emoticon) by the Owner of that code.To commit the PR to the repo do not use the Big Green Button. Instead, do a typicalpush that you would use with Git (e.g. local pull, rebase, merge, push).Source Code ManagementBranch strategyIn general:master has the code for the latest release on NuGet.org. (e.g. 1.0.0, 1.1.0)dev has the code that is being worked on but not yet released. This is the branch intowhich devs normally submit pull requests and merge changes into. We run daily CItowards dev branch and generate pre-release nuget package, e.g. 1.0.1-alpha-9-abcdefsd.hotfix has the code for ﬁxing master bug after it is released. hotfix changes will bemerged back to master and dev once it is veriﬁed.Solution and project folder structure and namingSolution ﬁles go in the repo root. The default entry point is All.sln.Every project also needs a project.json and a matching .xproj ﬁle. This project.json is thesource of truth for a project's dependencies and conﬁguration options.Solution need to contain solution folders that match the physical folder (src, test, tools,etc.).Assembly naming pattern",

This will help ensure that thestandard is followed by all developers on the team in a consistent manner.\"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers writecode that humans understand\".Martin Fowler. Refactoring: Improving the design of existing code.PurposeThe aim of this section is to deﬁne a set of C# coding standards to be used by CAPS buildteam to guarantee maximum legibility, reliability, re-usability and homogeneity of our code.Each section is marked Mandatory or Recommended. Mandatory sections, will be enforcedduring code reviews as well as tools like StyleCop and FxCop, and code will not beconsidered complete until it is compliant.ScopeThis section contains general C# coding standards which can be applied to any type ofapplication developed in C#, based on Framework Design Guidelines\uF1C5.It does not pretend to be a tutorial on C#. It only includes a set of limitations andrecommendations focused on clarifying the development.ToolsResharper\uF1C5 is a great 3rd party code cleanup and style tool.StyleCop\uF1C5 analyzes C# srouce code to enforce a set of style and consistency rules andhas been integrated into many 3rd party development tools such as Resharper.FxCop\uF1C5 is an application that analyzes managed code assemblies (code that targetsthe .NET Framework common language runtime) and reports information about theassemblies, such as possible design, localization, performance, and securityimprovements.C# Stylizer\uF1C5 does many of the style rules automaticallyHighlights of Coding StandardsThis section is not intended to give a summary of all the coding standards that enabled byour customized StyleCop, but to give a highlight of some rules one will possibly meet in",
