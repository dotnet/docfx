        # Add-History

        ## SYNOPSIS
        Appends entries to the session history.

        ## SYNTAX

        ```
        Add-History [[-InputObject] <PSObject[]>] [-Passthru] [<CommonParameters>]
        ```

        ## DESCRIPTION

        The `Add-History` cmdlet adds entries to the end of the session history, that is, the list of
        commands entered during the current session.

        The session history is a list of the commands entered during the session. The session history
        represents the order of execution, the status, and the start and end times of the command. As you
        enter each command, PowerShell adds it to the history so that you can reuse it. For more information
        about the session history, see [about_History](About/about_History.md).

        The session history is managed separately from the history maintained by the **PSReadLine** module.
        Both histories are available in sessions where **PSReadLine** is loaded. This cmdlet only works with
        the session history. For more information see, [about_PSReadLine](../PSReadLine/About/about_PSReadLine.md).

        You can use the `Get-History` cmdlet to get the commands and pass them to `Add-History`, or you can
        export the commands to a CSV or XML file, then import the commands, and pass the imported file to
        `Add-History`. You can use this cmdlet to add specific commands to the history or to create a single
        history file that includes commands from more than one session.

        ## EXAMPLES

        ### Example 1: Add commands to the history of a different session

        This example add the commands typed in one PowerShell session to the history of a different
        PowerShell session.

        ```powershell
        Get-History | Export-Csv c:\testing\history.csv -IncludeTypeInformation
        Import-Csv c:\testing\history.csv | Add-History
        ```

        The first command gets objects representing the commands in the history and exports them to the
        `History.csv` file.

        The second command is typed at the command line of a different session. It uses the `Import-Csv`
        cmdlet to import the objects in the `History.csv` file. The pipeline operator (`|`) passes the
        objects to the `Add-History` cmdlet, which adds the objects representing the commands in the
        `History.csv` file to the current session history.

        ### Example 2: Import and run commands

        This example imports commands from the `History.xml` file, adds them to the current session history,
        and then runs the commands in the combined history.

        ```powershell
        Import-Clixml c:\temp\history.xml | Add-History -PassThru | ForEach-Object -Process {Invoke-History}
        ```

        The first command uses the `Import-Clixml` cmdlet to import a command history that was exported to
        the `History.xml` file. The pipeline operator passes the commands to the `Add-History` cmdlet, which
        adds the commands to the current session history. The **PassThru** parameter passes the objects
        representing the added commands down the pipeline.

        The command then uses the `ForEach-Object` cmdlet to apply the `Invoke-History` command to each of
        the commands in the combined history. The `Invoke-History` command is formatted as a script block,
        enclosed in braces (`{}`), as required by the **Process** parameter of the `ForEach-Object` cmdlet.

        ### Example 3: Add commands in the history to the end of the history

        This example adds the first five commands in the history to the end of the history list.

        ```powershell
        Get-History -Id 5 -Count 5 | Add-History
        ```

        The `Get-History` cmdlet gets the five commands ending in command 5. The pipeline operator passes
        them to the `Add-History` cmdlet, which appends them to the current history. The `Add-History`
        command does not include any parameters, but PowerShell associates the objects passed through the
        pipeline with the **InputObject** parameter of `Add-History`.

        ### Example 4: Add commands in a .csv file to the current history

        This example add the commands in the `History.csv` file to the current session history.

        ```powershell
        $a = Import-Csv c:\testing\history.csv
        Add-History -InputObject $a -PassThru
        ```

        The `Import-Csv` cmdlet imports the commands in the `History.csv` file and
        store its contents in the variable `$a`.

        The second command uses the `Add-History` cmdlet to add the commands from `History.csv` to the
        current session history. It uses the **InputObject** parameter to specify the `$a` variable and the
        **PassThru** parameter to generate an object to display at the command line. Without the
        **PassThru** parameter, the `Add-History` cmdlet does not generate any output.

        ### Example 5: Add commands in an .xml file to the current history

        This example adds the commands in the `history.xml` file to the current session history.

        ```powershell
        Add-History -InputObject (Import-Clixml c:\temp\history.xml)
        ```

        The **InputObject** parameter passes the results of the command in parentheses to the `Add-History`
        cmdlet. The command in parentheses, which is executed first, imports the `history.xml` file into
        PowerShell. The `Add-History` cmdlet then adds the commands in the file to the session history.

        ## PARAMETERS

        ### -InputObject

        Specifies an array of entries to add to the history as **HistoryInfo** object to the session history.
        You can use this parameter to submit a **HistoryInfo** object, such as the ones that are returned by
        the `Get-History`, `Import-Clixml`, or `Import-Csv` cmdlets, to `Add-History`.

        ```yaml
        Type: System.Management.Automation.PSObject[]
        Parameter Sets: (All)
        Aliases:

        Required: False
        Position: 0
        Default value: None
        Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
        Accept wildcard characters: False
        ```

        ### -Passthru

        Indicates that this cmdlet returns a **HistoryInfo** object for each history entry. By default, this
        cmdlet does not generate any output.

        ```yaml
        Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
        Parameter Sets: (All)
        Aliases:

        Required: False
        Position: Named
        Default value: None
        Accept pipeline input: False
        Accept wildcard characters: False
        ```

        ### CommonParameters

        This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable,
        -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose,
        -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see
        [about_CommonParameters](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

        ## INPUTS

        ### Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.HistoryInfo

        You can pipe a **HistoryInfo** object to this cmdlet.

        ## OUTPUTS

        ### None or Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.HistoryInfo

        This cmdlet returns a **HistoryInfo** object if you specify the **PassThru** parameter. Otherwise,
        this cmdlet does not generate any output.

        ## NOTES

        The session history is a list of the commands entered during the session together with the ID. The
        session history represents the order of execution, the status, and the start and end times of the
        command. As you enter each command, PowerShell adds it to the history so that you can reuse it. For
        more information about the session history, see [about_History](About/about_History.md).

        To specify the commands to add to the history, use the **InputObject** parameter. The `Add-History`
        command accepts only **HistoryInfo** objects, such as those returned for each command by the
        `Get-History` cmdlet. You cannot pass it a path and file name or a list of commands.

        You can use the **InputObject** parameter to pass a file of **HistoryInfo** objects to
        `Add-History`. To do so, export the results of a `Get-History` command to a file by using the
        `Export-Csv` or `Export-Clixml` cmdlet and then import the file by using the `Import-Csv` or
        `Import-Clixml` cmdlets. You can then pass the file of imported **HistoryInfo** objects to
        `Add-History` through a pipeline or in a variable. For more information, see the examples.

        The file of **HistoryInfo** objects that you pass to the `Add-History` cmdlet must include the type
        information, column headings, and all of the properties of the **HistoryInfo** objects. If you
        intend to pass the objects back to `Add-History`, do not use the **NoTypeInformation** parameter of
        the `Export-Csv` cmdlet and do not delete the type information, column headings, or any fields in
        the file.

        To modify the session history, export the session to a CSV or XML file, modify the file, import the
        file, and use `Add-History` to append it to the current session history.
