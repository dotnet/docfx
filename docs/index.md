# Quick Start

Build your technical documentation site with docfx. Converts .NET assembly, XML code comment, REST API Swagger files and markdown into rendered HTML pages, JSON model or PDF files.

## Create a New Website

In this section we will build a simple documentation site on your local machine.

> Prerequisites
> - Familiarity with the command line
> - Install [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) 8.0 or higher
> - Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20 or higher (Optional: It's required when using [Create PDF Files](https://filzrev.github.io/docfx/docs/pdf.html))

Make sure you have [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) installed, then open a terminal and enter the following command to install the latest docfx:

```bash
dotnet tool update -g docfx
```

To create a new docset, run:

```bash
docfx init
```

This command walks you through creating a new docfx project under the current working directory. To build the docset, run: 

```bash
docfx docfx.json --serve
```

Now you can preview the website on <http://localhost:8080>.

To preview your local changes, save changes then run this command in a new terminal to rebuild the website:

```bash
docfx docfx.json
```

## Publish to GitHub Pages

Docfx produces static HTML files under the `_site` folder ready for publishing to any static site hosting servers.

To publish to GitHub Pages:
1. [Enable GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart).
2. Upload `_site` folder to GitHub Pages using GitHub actions.

This is an example GitHub action file that publishes documents to the `gh-pages` branch:

```yaml
# Your GitHub workflow file under .github/workflows/
# Trigger the action on push to main
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  actions: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false
  
jobs:
  publish-docs:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Dotnet Setup
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3
      with:
        dotnet-version: 8.x

    - run: dotnet tool update -g docfx
    - run: docfx <docfx-project-path>/docfx.json

    - name: Upload artifact
      uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
      with:
        # Upload entire repository
        path: '<docfx-project-path>/_site'
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      id: deployment
      uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

## Use the NuGet Library

You can also use docfx as a NuGet library:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Docfx.App" Version="2.77.0" />
<!-- the versions of Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.* must match exactly what Docfx.App was built against, not the latest stable version -->
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces.MSBuild" Version="4.10.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Workspaces" Version="4.10.0" />
```

Then build a docset using:

```cs
await Docfx.Dotnet.DotnetApiCatalog.GenerateManagedReferenceYamlFiles("docfx.json");
await Docfx.Docset.Build("docfx.json");
```

See [API References](api/Docfx.yml) for additional APIs.

##  How to use prerelease version of docfx

Docfx publishes nightly builds to [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx/pkgs/nuget/docfx).
If you want to use prerelease version, you can install package with following steps.

### Prerequisite

1. Install [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) command.
2. Install PowerShell 7.x or later.

### Steps

1. Open PowerShell on working directory.

2. Login to GitHub with additional scope request

    ```pwsh
    gh auth login --scopes "read:packages" --hostname github.com
    ```

3. Follow the instructions and complete the login steps.

4. Download docfx nuget package from GitHub Packages

    ```pwsh
    # Gets Access Token
    $token = gh auth token

    # Gets the version of latest nightly build
    $version = gh api /orgs/dotnet/packages/nuget/docfx/versions --jq '.[0].name'

    # Gets nupkg download URL.
    $downloadUrl = "https://nuget.pkg.github.com/dotnet/download/docfx/${version}/${version}.nupkg"

    # Download nupkg to current directory.
    Write-Host ('Download nupkg from: {0}' -f $downloadUrl)
    Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri $downloadUrl -OutFile "docfx.${version}.nupkg" -Headers @{
      Authorization = "Bearer $token"
    }
    ```

5. Install docfx as .NET Global Package from local source

    ```pwsh
    dotnet tool update docfx -g --prerelease --source ./
    ```
