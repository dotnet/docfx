# Source Path

In `.publish.json file`,`source_path` represents the source file's relative path to docset root.

It will be used in PR comments to indicate the path of the files containing errors/warnings/suggestions.


# Design of SourceMap

## Definition

|  Name  |   Concept   |
|-|-|
| _raw source file_   | the files in content repository, e.g. https://github.com/Azure/azure-docs-sdk-dotnet/blob/main/xml/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer/FormRecognizerLanguage.xml | 
| _build source file_ | the files are to be built by DoxFX, which may be the raw source file or the **preprocessed result** files of raw source files | 
| source_path | the property in .publish.json file | 


For most cases, _raw source file_ and _build source file_ are the **SAME**. 

And the same source_path corresponds to the same _build source file_ (and _raw source file_) file (i.e. One-To-One). And the value of source_path is the _build source file_(and _raw source file_)'s file path.

For some special cases, it is allowed to config mappings to resolve customized source_path values, named **SourceMap**  

|  key                          |  Value            |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| _build source file_ file path | source_path value |


Due to **SourceMap**, multiple _build source file_  may have the same source_path (i.e. **Many-To-One**). And the source_path value may be NOT equal to the _build source file_ 's physical file path.

## Usage Examples

For non-standard yml files or markdown files (e.g. MonoDocXml used by DotNet language repos, MAML used by Powershell language repos), before executing DocFX build, **OpsPreProcessor** will pre-process the raw files.

And multiple standard yml files may be generated for single raw file, i.e. multiple  _build source files_ for single _raw source file_  
And **SourceMap**s will be auto generated by **OpsPreProcessor** to record the mapping relationship between raw files and generated yml files.



# Questions

# Q1: What about Service Page case ? 
Ans: Service pages are generated when build from multiple source files (i.e. Toc files). Virtual file paths are generated for them, refer to code https://github.com/dotnet/docfx/blob/0db0fef6a31cdb5a6cb366abc81922e9df201508/src/docfx/build/toc/ServicePageGenerator.cs#L82 and https://github.com/dotnet/docfx/blob/0db0fef6a31cdb5a6cb366abc81922e9df201508/src/docfx/build/toc/ServicePageGenerator.cs#L167
