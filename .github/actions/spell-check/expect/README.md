The contents of each `.txt` file in this directory are merged together.

* [alphabet](alphabet.txt) is a sample for alphabet related items
* [web](web.txt) is a sample for web/html related items
* [expect](expect.txt) is the main list of expected items -- there is nothing
particularly special about the file name (beyond the extension which is
important).

These terms are things which temporarily exist in the project, but which
aren't necessarily words.

If something is a word that could come and go, it probably belongs in a
[dictionary](../dictionary/README.md).
