# Dictionaries are lists of words to accept unconditionally

While check spelling will complain about a whitelisted word
which is no longer present, you can include things here even if
they are not otherwise present in the repository.

E.g., you could include a list of system APIs here, or potential
contributors (so that if a future commit includes their name,
it'll be accepted).
