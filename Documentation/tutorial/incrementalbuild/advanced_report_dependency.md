ðŸ”§ Advanced: Report Dependency
=================================

DocFX Incremental Build Framework provides the flexiblity to register customized dependency type and report dependency. In this topic, we will go through how to do that.

*Register Dependency Type*
---------------------------

### Dependency type

Property                 | Type                                 | Description
-----------------------  | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Name**                 | string                               | name of the dependency type(it should be unique)
Phase                    | enum(`Compile` or `Link`)            | the build phase that this type of dependency could have an effect on.
Transitivity             | enum(`None` or `SameType` or `All`)  | whether the dependency is transitive, transitive upon the dependencies with same type, or transitive upon any dependency.


#### Reserved dependency types

Below table lists all reserved dependency types. When creating a customized dependency type, name shouldn't conflict with the reserved ones.

**Name**                 | Phase                 | Transitivity             | Description
-----------------------  | ----------------------| -------------------------| -----------------------------------------------------------------------
include                  | Compile               | All                      | file inclusion and code snippet
uid                      | Link                  | None                     | cross reference
file                     | Link                  | None                     | file link
overwrite                | Link                  | All                      | overwrite files
bookmark                 | Link                  | None                     | file link with bookmark
metadata                 | Link                  | None                     | metadata related dependency
reference                | Link                  | None                     | managed reference document's references

#### Register a customized dependency type

Plugins are flexible to register customized dependency types by implementing @Microsoft.DocAsCode.Plugins.ISupportIncrementalBuildStep interface's method @Microsoft.DocAsCode.Plugins.ISupportIncrementalBuildStep.GetDependencyTypesToRegister. The method would be called by the framework at the very start of the whole build.

Sample code:

```csharp
    public IEnumerable<DependencyType> GetDependencyTypesToRegister() => new[]
    {
        new DependencyType()
        {
            Name = "ref",
            Phase = BuildPhase.Link,
            Transitivity = DependencyTransitivity.None,
        }
    };
```

*Report Dependency item*
-------------------

### DependencyItem model

Property                 | Type                                                   | Description
-----------------------  | -------------------------------------------------------| ----------------------------
From                     | [DependencyItemSourceInfo](#dependencyitemsourceinfo-model)  | the depending one
To                       | [DependencyItemSourceInfo](#dependencyitemsourceinfo-model)  | the dependent one
Type                     | string                                                 | the dependency type name

### DependencyItemSourceInfo model

Property                 | Type            | Description
-----------------------  | ----------------| -----------------------------------------------------------
sourceType               | string          | the type of the value. `file` and `uid` are reserved types  
value                    | string          | value

### How to report

@Microsoft.DocAsCode.Plugins.IHostService interface provides the methods to report directed/reversed dependency items.

If you want to report the dependency between an file and another file, you can use below method:

directed dependency: @Microsoft.DocAsCode.Plugins.IHostService.ReportDependencyTo(Microsoft.DocAsCode.Plugins.FileModel,System.String,System.String)

reversed dependency: @Microsoft.DocAsCode.Plugins.IHostService.ReportDependencyFrom(Microsoft.DocAsCode.Plugins.FileModel,System.String,System.String)

For example, i'd like to report a dependency: file `~/test.md`(filemodel is `a`) depends on file `~/../include/token/md`, dependency type is `include`,
i could call the method `ReportDependencyTo(a, "~/../include/token.md", "include")`.

Plugins are only allowed to report a dependency during `Compile` phase. However, some plugins might don't have enough info to resolve some dependency to file until the whole phase completes. Incremental build framework provides the flexiblity that plugins could report dependency between items that are not files and resolve them later.

directed dependency: @Microsoft.DocAsCode.Plugins.IHostService.ReportDependencyTo(Microsoft.DocAsCode.Plugins.FileModel,System.String,System.String,System.String)

reversed dependency: @Microsoft.DocAsCode.Plugins.IHostService.ReportDependencyFrom(Microsoft.DocAsCode.Plugins.FileModel,System.String,System.String,System.String)

report reference:    @Microsoft.DocAsCode.Plugins.IHostService.ReportReference(Microsoft.DocAsCode.Plugins.FileModel,System.String,System.String)

A common usage is to report dependency between file and uid.

For example, i'd like to report a dependency: file `~/test.md`(filemodel is `a`) depends on sentenceId @Testid(filemodel is `b`), dependency type is `link`,
i could call the method `ReportDependencyTo(a, "Testid", "sentenceId", "link")` to report the dependency and `ReportReference(b, "Testid", "sentenceId")` to report the mapping between sentenceId and file. This way, the framework would do the resolution work and resolve it to file-file dependency.
