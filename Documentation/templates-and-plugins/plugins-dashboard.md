# Dashboard for Templates
The templates listed here mainly focus on the functionality of the generated website, it often contains a *plugins* folder containing assemblies for advanced processing of the data model. It usually also contains corresponding renderer files to further transform the processed data model to web pages. You can follow [How to Create Custom Document Processors](../tutorial/howto_build_your_own_type_of_documentation_with_custom_plug-in.md) and [How to Create Custom PostProcessor](../tutorial/howto_add_a_customized_post_processor.md) to create your own plugins. Add your own customized templates and plugins here for others to view and use!
