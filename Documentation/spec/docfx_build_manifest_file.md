Data structure for manifest file generated by `docfx build`
===========================

After `docfx build`, `docfx` generates a manifest file in JSON format in the root output folder, listing some basic information about the set of files that `docfx build` handles.

Before *DocFX* version 1.7, the manifest file is an Array of items. Then *DocFX* realizes that there are also global properties manifest file consumers care about, for example, the list of TOC files that *DocFX* processed. However, it is hard to add properties to an Array model. So since version 1.8, *DocFX* introduces a new Object model for the manifest file.

For backward compatibility, in version 1.8, *DocFX* generates both Array model to-be-obsoleted and the new Object model. 

In version 1.9, manifest file in Array model will be **removed**.

Below table shows the difference between manifest file in Array model and manifest file in Object model.

| | File Name | Data Model
|-|-|-|
|Old Array Model | `.manifest` | [Array model](#the-obsoleted-array-model)
|New Object Model | `.manifest.json` | [Object model](#the-new-object-model)

The obsoleted Array model
-------------------------
Array model contains a list of [Manifest Item](#manifest-item-model)s.

The new Object model
-----------------------
Current supported properties for the Object model is listed as below:

Property Name | Type              | Description
------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------
*files*       | Array of *Manifest Item* | Array of [*Manifest Item* model](#-manifest-item-model)
*homepages*   | Array of *Homepage* | Array of [*Homepage* model](#-homepage-model)

*Manifest Item* model
-----------------------

Property Name | Type              | Description
------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------
*type*        | string            | The `documentType` is generated by plugins or specified to each file using [Yaml Header](docfx_flavored_markdown.md#yaml-header). Currently by default *DocFX* generates following *document type*s: `ManagedReference`, `Conceptual`, `RestApi`, `Resource`, `toc`.
*original*    | string            | Specifies the input file path to the root folder of the *Git* repository. It is the absolute file path if the file is not inside a *Git* repository. 
*outputFiles* | Dictionary&lt;string,string&gt; | For each output file, the **key** is the extension of the transformed file, the extension is determined by the template it applies to. And the **value** is the output file path relative to the manifest file.


*Homepage* model
-----------------------

Property Name | Type              | Description
------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------
*tocPath*     | string            | Specifies the output TOC file path relative to the manifest file.
*homepage*    | string            | Specifies the homepage for current TOC with file path relative to the manifest file.
