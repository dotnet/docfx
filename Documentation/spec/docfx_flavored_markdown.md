Docfx Flavored Markdown
==========================================
Docfx supports "Docfx Flavored Markdown," or DFM. It is 100% compatiable with [Github Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/), and adds some additional functionality, including cross reference and file inclusion.

### Cross Reference
Using `@uid` to quickly reference to other documentations.
Generally the value of `uid` can be found in the `YAML` file generated by running `docfx metadata`. For API in DOTNET world, [2.Identifiers in Metadata Dotnet Spec](metadata_dotnet_spec.md) describes the way to generate `id` for API in dotnet language. For other files, you can add YAML header at the top of the file to define its id.
```md
---
uid: A.md
---
This is a markdown file
```

### File Inclusion
DFM adds syntax to include other file parts into current file, such file parts can be code snippets or simply plain text.
```
{{<filepath>[<startline>-<endline>, <anotherline>]}}
```
`<filepath>` can be wrapped by `'`, `"` if it contains `[`,`}`,`-`.
Line number can be ommited. If ommited, the whole content from the file will be included.
