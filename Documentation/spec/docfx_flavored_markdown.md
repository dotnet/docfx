DocFX Flavored Markdown
==========================================
DocFX supports "DocFX Flavored Markdown," or DFM. It is 100% compatible with [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/), and adds some additional functionality, including cross reference and file inclusion.
### Yaml Header
Yaml header in DFM is considered as the metadata for the Markdown file. It will transform to `yamlheader` tag when processed.
Yaml header MUST be the first thing in the file and MUST take the form of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines. Here is a basic example:

```md
---
uid: A.md
title: A
---
```

### Cross Reference
Cross reference means referencing other files, including *Conceptual Documentation* and *API Documentation*, using `uid` value for the file.

#### What is `uid` value for a file?
1.  For *Conceptual Documentation*

    Add a yaml header to the *Conceptual Documentation* to specify its `uid` value.

    ```md
    ---
    uid: uidForTheFile
    ---
    This is a conceptual file with `uid` specified.
    ```
2.  For *API Documentation*

    Generally, the value of `uid` can be found in the `YAML` file generated by running `docfx metadata`. For API in DOTNET world, [2.Identifiers in Metadata Dotnet Spec](metadata_dotnet_spec.md) describes the way to generate `id` for API in dotnet language.

#### Syntax for cross reference
1.  Link style: `[name](xref:uid "title")`

    If there is a `dfm.md` file with `uid` as `dfm`:

    ```md
    ---
    uid: dfm
    ---
    # DocfxFlavoredMarkdown
    This is dfm.md
    ```
    We can quickly reference to this file `dfm.md` in another Markdown file using:

    ```md
    [DFM](xref:dfm "This is a dfm")
    ```
    It will transform to `<a href="dfm.md" title="This is a dfm">DFM</a>` in the final html file. If `name` empty, `docfx` uses the title of `dfm.md` as the default name, for example, `[](xref:dfm)` will be transformed to `<a href="dfm.md">DocfxFlavoredMarkdown</a>`.

2.  Autolink style: `<xref:uid>`

    Still take `dfm.md` as an example, `<xref:dfm>` will transform to `<a href="dfm.md">DocfxFlavoredMarkdown</a>`. The title of `dfm.md` is taken as the display name.

3.  Shortcut: `@uid`

    Syntax for `@uid` is as below:
    1. If content after `@` is wrapped by `'` or `"`,  it contains any character including white space.
    2. If content after `@` is not wrapped by `'` or `"`, it must start with word character `a-z` or `A-Z`, and it ends when:
        1. line ends
        2. meets whitespaces
        3. line ends with `.`, `,`, `;`, `:`, `!`, `?` and `~`
        4. meets 2 times or more `.`, `,`, `;`, `:`, `!`, `?` and `~`

    So `@dfm` will also be transformed to `<a href="dfm.md">DocfxFlavoredMarkdown</a>`. The title of `dfm.md` is taken as the display name.

### File Inclusion
DFM adds syntax to include other file parts into current file, the included file will also be considered as in DFM syntax. *NOTE* that YAML header is **NOT** supported when the file is an inclusion.
There are two types of file inclusion: Inline and block, as similar to inline code span and block code.

#### Inline
Inline file inclusion is in the following syntax, in which `<title>` stands for the title of the included file, and `<filepath>` stands for the file path of the included file. The file path can be either absolute or relative.`<filepath>` can be wrapped by `'` or `"`. *NOTE* that for inline file inclusion, the file included will be considered as containing only inline tags, for example, `###header` inside the file will not transfer since `<h3>` is a block tag, while `[a](b)` will transform to `<a href='b'>a</a>` since `<a>` is an inline tag.
```
...Other inline contents... [!include[<title>](<filepath>)]
```
#### Block
Block file inclusion must be in a single line and with no prefix characters before the start `[`. Content inside the included file will transform using DFM syntax.
```md
[!include[<title>](<filepath>)]
```

### Section definition
User may need to define section. Mostly used for code table.
Give an example below.

    [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets" data-resources="OutlookServices.Calendar"]
    ```cs
    <cs code text>
    ```
    ```javascript
    <js code text>
    ```

The above blockquote Markdown text will transform to section html as in the following:
```
<div class="tabbedCodeSnippets" data-resources="OutlookServices.Calendar">
  <pre><code>cs code text</code></pre>
  <pre><code>js code text</code></pre>
</div>
```

### Code Snippet
Allows you to insert code with code language specified. The content of specified code path will expand.

```md
[!code-<language>[<name>](<codepath><queryoption><queryoptionvalue> "<title>")]
```

* __`<language>`__ can be made up of any number of character and '-'. However, the recommended value should follow [Highlight.js language names and aliases](http://highlightjs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/css-classes-reference.html#language-names-and-aliases).
* __`<codepath>`__ is the relative path in file system which indicates the code snippet file that you want to expand.
* __`<queryoption>`__ and __`<queryoptionvalue>`__ are used together to retrieve part of the code snippet file in the line range or tag name way. We have 2 query string options to represent these two ways:

|                          | query string using `#`                 | query string using `?`
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------
| 1. line range            | `#L{startlinenumber}-L{endlinenumber}` | `?start={startlinenumber}&end={endlinenumber}`
| 2. tagname               | `#{tagname}`                           | `?name={tagname}`
| 3. multiple region range | _Unsupported_                          | `?range={rangequerystring}`
* __`<title>`__ can be omitted.

#### Code Snippet Sample
```md
[!code-csharp[Main](Program.cs)]

[!code[Main](Program.cs#L12-L16 "This is source file")]
[!code-vb[Main](../Application/Program.vb#testsnippet "This is source file")]

[!code[Main](index.xml?start=5&end=9)]
[!code-javascript[Main](../jquery.js?name=testsnippet)]
[!code[Main](index.xml?range=2,5-7,9-) "This includes the lines 2, 5, 6, 7 and lines 9 to the last line"]
```

#### Tag Name Representation in Code Snippet Source File
DFM currently only supports the following __`<language>`__ values to be able to retrieve by tag name:
* C#: cs, csharp
* VB: vb, vbnet
* C++: cpp, c++
* F#: fsharp
* XML: xml
* Html: html
* SQL: sql
* Javascript: javascript


### Note (Warning/Tip/Important)
Using specific syntax inside block quote to indicate the following content is Note.

```
> [!NOTE]
> <note content>
> [!WARNING]
> <warning content>
```

The above content will be transformed to the following html:

```
<div class="NOTE">
  <h5>NOTE</h5>
  <p>note content</p>
</div>
<div class="WARNING">
  <h5>WARNING</h5>
  <p>WARNING content</p>
</div>
```
